## A game of tag built using a star pathfinding. 

A small project to help understand the concepts of pathfinding and states for enemies. It is a game of tag with the red circle as the player and the blue as the enemy. Once the game starts, the enemy will attempt to collide with the player, once this happens the enemy will switch to a flee state and try to evade the player.

This project was built using a star pathfinding with the target destination being altered based on enemy state.

Below is a short demonstration of the project in action.
